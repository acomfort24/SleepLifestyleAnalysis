        <h2>GOAL</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to analyze the relationship among sleep health factors within a population, with a specific
            focus on both the female and male genders. This analysis relies on the provided associations found in the
            Sleep &amp; Health dataset. To achieve this, we will utilize the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. Our
            investigation will delve into how different variables such as blood pressure, stress levels, sleep
            duration, physical activity levels, and location correlate with sleep quality, sleep disorders, and other
            significant factors for each gender.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>Our primary aim is to uncover patterns, similarities, and distinctions in the manner specific variables impact
            the overall sleep health and well-being of each gender. By conducting an analysis of sleep disorders
            categorized by occupation and gender, evaluating sleep quality relative to location and gender, studying
            the influence of physical activity on sleep quality in relation to gender, as well as exploring stress and
            blood pressure data, we intend to extract valuable insights regarding the potential effects of sleep on
            various health parameters. These findings can subsequently be applied to formulate strategies that endorse
            healthy sleep habits, identify at-risk communities within each gender, and potentially contribute to the
            development of interventions or treatments targeting sleep-related health issues.</p>
